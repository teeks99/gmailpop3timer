# GMail Pop3 Timer Checker
Userscript for greasemonkey/tampermonkey that causes gamil to check pop3 boxes more frequently.

This was originally based on Daniel Slaughter's [Gmail POP3 Checker](https://www.danielslaughter.com/project/gmailpop3/)
scripts, but was reworked to avoid calls out to a server and be completely self-contained.

**This is currently in pre-alpha state, almost certainly is broken.**
